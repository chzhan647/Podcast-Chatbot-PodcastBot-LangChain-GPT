### Recommendation System 
### Building a podcast recommendation system 
Listening to podcasts is my go-to activity whenever I'm working out, driving or running errands. It's amazhing how podcasts can turn mundane moments into opportunities for learning and entertainment. 
I often search online for recommendations for my next podcasts, which inspired me to build a personalized podcast recommendation system tailored to my interests and preferences. 

#### Data 
Finding a collection of podcasts along with their genres and synopses in an automated way is challenging. So I decided to build a web scraper to extract podcast information from [Chartable](https://chartable.com/) using BeautifulSoup and save the list in Json file.
